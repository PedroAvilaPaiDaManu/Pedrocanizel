#to each aplicattion that you create you must add its name inside the settings.py, inside the variable INSTALLED_APPS

#inside the settings.py, inside the "DIRS: []" we must add the string 'templates', it refers to the dir template that we will create to insert our templates.

python manage.py runserver ###to run our server, we must to bem in the same local that tht file settings.py is, after that we must tipe the comand.

ctrl c ###stop the server

#inside the views.py you create python function that returns the messages you want to show on the screen, example:
def index(request):
    return render(request, 'index.html'


###It's a good practice to create a urls.py inside the application, to be clearly in your code and not to swamp the urls.py from the project,
inside the project.urls >>>from django.urls imoporth path, include this include will refer the core.urls that is in your app inside the project.urls,
this way >>> path('', include('core.urls')).
after this, inside the core.urls.py >>>from django.urls import path
                                       from .views import index, contact
                                       urlpatterns = [
                                           path('', index)
                                           path('contact', contact)
                                       ]


###in the file urls.py i need to import the functions from the views.py >>>from core.views import index, after this, inside the variable >>>urlpatterns you must insert
the name of the path and the function it receives:
path('', index), ###when i open and clos '' it becomes my root app
path('contact', contact) ###when i insert the name 'contact' i say the name of the hierarchy 

###create e directory inside the app core, and inside the directiory you create the page.html
